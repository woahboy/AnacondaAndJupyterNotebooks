    "## A Primer On Using LaTeX in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) have become one of the dominant tools for data scientists. Noteboks allow you to have code, text, math notation, and images all in the same document. They are also easily shareable so others can repeat the analysis, such as detecting [gravitational waves with LIGO](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html). Notebooks have also been used as entire [online textbooks](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)."

    "One of my favorite features is using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (pronounced Lah-Tek) to include mathematical notation directly in the text, rendered with MathJax. If you haven't encountered it before, LaTeX is the standard for typesetting technical and scientific documents. With LaTeX, you can write any document but it also includes the capability to write out mathematical notation. MathJax uses the LaTeX symbols to render math directly in the browser. "

    "This is an extremely useful feature of Jupyter notebooks, but many people lack the LaTeX experience to take advantage of it. So here I'm going to provide a primer on writing mathematical notation in LaTeX. This won't cover everything LaTeX can do (apparently it's [Turing complete](https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2012/04/24/latex-is-more-powerful-than-you-think.html)), instead I'll give you the basics so you can get started including math notation in your notebooks."

    "### Math typesetting basics\n",
    "There are two modes for writing LaTeX in notebooks, inline and display. Inline expressions are rendered inline with text, while displayed expressions are on their own lines. Inline mode looks like this: $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$ and display mode looks like this $$e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{n^x}{n!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The math is rendered differently depending on the mode, see the same equation as above as an inline expression: $e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{n^x}{n!}$ "

   "source": [
    "To write math inline, you use single dollar signs like this `$y=mx+b$` which results in $y=mx+b$. Everything between the dollar signs is rendered as mathematical notation. To create a display expression, use two dollar signs `$$P(A\\mid B) = \\frac{P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$` which looks like $$P(A\\mid B) = \\frac{P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$"

    "Superscript for exponents is done with a caret, `$x^2$` gives $x^2$. Sometimes you'll want multiple things in the exponent and you might try `$e^2x$` but that doe this $e^2x$. Instead, if you wrap the exponent in braces: `$e^{2x}$` renders as $e^{2x}$. You can similarly use subscript text using underscore `x_i` is $x_i$. The underscore can be used without a leading character too: `_{10}C_5` is $_{10}C_5$"

For example, to create a square root radical, `$\\sqrt{2\\pi}$` gives $\\sqrt{2\\pi}$. The braces `{}` include the contents under the radical and `\\pi` renders as the Greek letter pi $(\\pi)$. Displaying the fraction above is done with the `\\frac` command. It takes two inputs, one for the numerator and one for the denominator, each enclosed in braces. "
